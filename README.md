This is an URL Shortener app that accepts a link in the input field, saves it to the MongoDB database and return a JSON with a shortened version of the URL. Also, it will throw a JSON message with an error in case if incorrect URL is being passed as an input.

Then, you can put in the link with the shortURL value as `https://url-shortener.konstantinik1.repl.co/api/shorturl/:shortURL` and the app will address you to the corresponding site.
